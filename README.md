# üè• Revenue Cycle Management (RCM) Dashboard ‚Äì Tableau Project

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ **Denial Summary**
- **Description**: Bar chart showing **total denied charges**, **denial rate**, and **month-over-month % change**.
- **Insight**: Helps uncover trends in claim denials and monitor denial management effectiveness. Rising denial rates can highlight coding or authorization issues.
